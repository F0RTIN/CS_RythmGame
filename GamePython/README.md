This project is a rythm game done with pygame lib.

We have a Main menu from which you can launch a game or check the leaderboard stock in a .csv.
The Leaderboard goes in the csv and display a leaderboard from best to worst score with the username attached.

In a game, tiles travel from top to bottom screen at an individual, random and constant speed. When the tile is about on top of the correponding button, you press the key that activates the button and a collision test is done. If we have a collision between the button and the tile, +10 points. If not 0 points.

At the end of each game, you enter a username and your score is stocked with it in the .csv
